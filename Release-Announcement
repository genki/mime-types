The MIME::Types project is not dead! The release of MIME::Types 1.15
marks the last version that was synchronized in any way with the Perl
MIME::Types list. Future versions of MIME::Types will be synchronized
only with the IANA type list, but will also add many other features that
will significantly enhance the functionality and capability of
MIME::Types for Ruby.

The main changes made in this version are:

  * MIME::Type (an instance of a single type) no longer has a separate
    source file.
  * The amount of meta-data about a MIME::Type has been increased.
    Future versions of MIME::Types will include functionality that
    increases the usability of this metadata.

= What is MIME::Types for Ruby?
This allows for the identification of a file's likely MIME content type
based on the file's filename extension.

== LICENCE NOTES
MIME::Types is available under Ruby's disjunctive licence with the GNU
GPL or the Perl Artistic licence. See the file LICENCE in the package
for full details.

== Requirements and Installation
PDF::Writer requires Ruby 1.8.2.

Once these packages are installed, MIME::Types can be installed with:

 % ruby setup.rb

Alternatively, you can use the RubyGems version of MIME::Types available
as mime-types-1.15.gem from the usual sources.

== MIME::Types 1.15
* Removed lib/mime/type.rb to form a single MIME::Types database source. It
  is unlikely that one will ever need MIME::Type without MIME::Types.
* Re-synchronized the MIME type list with the sources, focusing primarily on
  the IANA list.
* Added more detailed source information for MIME::Type objects.
* Changed MIME::Types from a module to a class with a default instance. There
  should be no difference in usage.
* Removed MIME::Types::DATA_VERSION; it is now an attribute on the
  MIME::Types instance.
* NOTE: Synchronization with the Perl version of MIME::Types is no longer a
  priority as of this release. The data format and information has changed.

== Release Mechanism
Thanks goes to Aslak Hellesoy for MetaProject (http://xforge.rubyforge.org)
and Park Heesob for Gmailer (http://rubyforge.org/projects/gmailutils) for
their excellent utilities that have automated most of my release process.
